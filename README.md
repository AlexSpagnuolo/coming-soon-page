# Assignment 1: Business card website

#### ⚑ Due before class week 2

**Create a business card website to act as the coming soon page for your portfolio.**

#### [⬇ See an example wireframe](https://github.com/acgd-webdev-4/assignment-1/blob/master/wireframe.png)

---

## Details

- Approx. completion time: **3 hours**
- Deliverables: **1 HTML file, 1 CSS file, images**

Make a single page, coming soon website as a placeholder for your portfolio—but it should not say “coming soon” or “under construction” anywhere. Think of it as a business card website.

The [included wireframe](https://github.com/acgd-webdev-4/assignment-1/blob/master/wireframe.png) is an example of what you might do on large screen websites. *It’s up to you to design it for all screen sizes.*

- Should contain the following information: your name, a brief bio, email address, social media links, photo or icon.
- Make sure the website is flexible 320px – ~2500px.
- **We’ll be putting it live—on your domain—in week 2.**
